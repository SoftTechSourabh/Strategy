        -An IT roadmap is a type of technology roadmap that a business uses to
        develop and share a strategic-level plan for IT initiatives at the
        organization, such as migrating the company's data to a new cloud system
        or upgrading the organization to a new enterprise software platform.

        * Determine your strategic position. This preparation phase sets the
        foundation for all work going forward....
      </h6>

      <p>
        Before you begin the strategic planning process, it is important to
        review some steps to set you and your organization up for success.
      </p>
      <h6>* Prioritize your objectives....</h6>
      <h6>* Develop a plan....</h6>
      <h6>* Execute and manage the plan....</h6>
      <h6>* Review and revise the plan.</h6>

      <p>
        This preparation phase sets the foundation for all work going forward.
        You need to know where you are to determine where you need to go and how
        you will get there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have identified your current position in the market, it is time
        to determine objectives that will help you achieve your goals. Your
        objectives should align with your company mission and vision. Prioritize
        your objectives by asking important questions such as: Which of these
        initiatives will have the greatest impact on achieving our company
        mission/vision and improving our position in the market? What types of
        impact are most important (e.g. customer acquisition vs. revenue)? How
        will the competition react? Which initiatives are most urgent? What will
        we need to do to accomplish our goals? How will we measure our progress
        and determine whether we achieved our goals? Objectives should be
        distinct and measurable to help you reach your long-term strategic goals
        and initiatives outlined in step one. Potential objectives can be
        updating website content, improving email open rates, and generating new
        leads in the pipeline.
